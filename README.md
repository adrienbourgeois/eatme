EatMe
=====

EatMe uses your location to propose you a new way to find restaurants around you by showing you real pictures of the dishes.

How does it work?

An algorithm that is running all the time is listening to instagram. It looks for pictures that are within a certain area (i.e. in Sydney) and that contains certain hashtags (#foodporn, #instafood, etc). When it finds such a picture, it uses the picture location and try to find a place that match with "google-places API" so it can record the exact name and the exact address of the place in the data-base.
